MAX7219 Driver
==============

Interfacing LED matrix displays with the MAX7219 driver in Python using hardware SPI on the Raspberry Pi. 
The particular kit I bought can be acquired for a few pounds from 
http://www.banggood.com/MAX7219-Dot-Matrix-Module-DIY-Kit-SCM-Control-Module-For-Arduino-p-72178.html?currency=GBP 

Pre-requisites
--------------
Ensure that the SPI kernel driver is enabled:

    $ dmesg | grep spi
    [    3.769841] bcm2708_spi bcm2708_spi.0: master is unqueued, this is deprecated
    [    3.793364] bcm2708_spi bcm2708_spi.0: SPI Controller at 0x20204000 (irq 80)

And that the devices are successfully installed in /dev:

    $ ls -l /dev/spi*
    crw------- 1 root root 153, 0 Jan  1  1970 /dev/spidev0.0
    crw------- 1 root root 153, 1 Jan  1  1970 /dev/spidev0.1
    
Follow the advice in the references below if the devices do not appear before
proceeding.

GPIO pin-outs
-------------
The breakout board has an two headers to allow daisy-chaining:

| Board Pin | Name | Remarks | RPi Pin | RPi Function |
|--------:|:-----|:--------|--------:|--------------|
| 1 | VCC | +5V Power | 2 | 5V0 |
| 2 | GND | Ground | 6 | GND |
| 3 | DIN | Data In | 19 | GPIO 10 (MOSI) |
| 4 | CS | Chip Select | 24 | GPIO 8 (SPI CS0) |
| 5 | CLK | Clock | 23 | GPIO 11 (SPI CLK) |

Building & Installing
---------------------
The [SPI-Py](https://github.com/lthiery/SPI-Py) C-extension has already been 
included in the source directory, so to build and install: 

For Raspian:

    $ sudo python setup.py install

For Arch Linux:

    # pacman -Sy base-devel python2
    # python2 setup.py install


Examples
--------
Run the example code as follows:

    $ sudo python examples/test.py
